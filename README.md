# 🌍 3D Solar System – Three.js Project

An immersive, interactive 3D solar system simulation built using **Three.js**. This web application visualizes all 8 planets orbiting around the sun in real-time with features like adjustable orbit speed, tooltips, axial tilt toggle, and more.

## 🧠 Learnings

This project helped me understand:
- Working with Three.js for real-time 3D rendering
- Orbital mechanics (simplified) using math and vectors
- Handling 3D animations and interactivity in the browser
- Optimizing performance for smooth rendering across devices
